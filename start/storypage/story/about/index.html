<h1>About the Project</h1>

<p> This project explores the common phenomenon of culture shock, ways of adapting to the new environment, and the
  role design plays to help immigrants to understand the transitional experiences related to cultural differences post migration. </p>
  <p> Rahaâ€™s Journey specifically addresses the culture shock middle eastern and south Asian immigrants face
     during and post migration using actual stories collected from the people who have been through the immigration experience. </p>
     <p>Their stories
       and in-depth research resulted in the creation of a fictional narrative that is told through an interactive graphic novel. </p>



       <h1>Culture Shock</h1>
       <p>Culture shock is an experience a person may have when one moves to a cultural environment which is different from one's own;
         it is also the personal disorientation a person may feel when experiencing an unfamiliar way of life due to immigration or a
         visit to a new country, a move between social environments, or simply transition to another type of life. One of the most
         common causes of culture shock involves individuals in a foreign environment. Culture shock can be described as consisting
         of at least one of four distinct phases: honeymoon, negotiation, adjustment, and adaptation.</p>
